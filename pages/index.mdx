## Building blocks of a frontend architecture

- **User interface**: design tokens, theming system, shared components, icon library.
- **Documentation**: the single source of knowledge with guides, code snippets, best practices, and design patterns
- **Routing**: how users navigate between parts of the application.
- **Data fetching**: where data lives and how to get it.
- **Rendering**: when and where dynamic content is rendered.
- **Integrations**: 3rd-party services (CMS, visual editors, auth, payments, data grids, â€¦)
- **Infrastructure**: how we deploy, store, and run our applications.
- **Performance**: optimise our applications for both end-users and developers.
- **Developer experience**: the team's experience with building and maintaining our applications.
